Schedulify - JS+HTML5 web based to-do list


HTML+CSS done by me (edited by my main website's actually, because I suck at CSS)

JS code based on w3school's JS to-do list exercise

Took 3-4 hours for the entire project and I suck at web dev, so expect it to be really buggy and stuff.
Desktop site is working perfectly, while mobile is a non-working mess.
To-dos stay upon closing page and reopening :-)
